Introduction
Customer segmentation is a vital strategy for businesses to better understand their customers and tailor their products or services to meet their unique needs. This project uses clustering techniques to segment customers into distinct groups based on their credit card behavior.

Getting Started
To run the code provided in this repository, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required Python libraries listed in the code using pip or conda.
Run the Jupyter Notebook file (Customer_Segmentation.ipynb) to execute the code step by step.
Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis contains information on 8950 credit card holders, including features such as balance, purchases, payments, credit limit, and more. Each row represents a customer, and the goal is to segment them into meaningful groups.

Code Explanation
The code is organized as follows:

Importing Libraries: Required libraries for data analysis and visualization are imported.
Loading the Dataset: The dataset is loaded and initial data preprocessing is performed.
Data Preprocessing and EDA: Data cleaning, handling missing values, and exploratory data analysis are conducted.
Clustering Methods: K-Means clustering and PCA are applied to segment customers.
Conclusion: Final insights and conclusions from the analysis.
Results
The analysis results in the segmentation of customers into distinct clusters based on their credit card behavior. Visualizations and interpretations are provided to understand the characteristics of each cluster.

Conclusion
Customer segmentation using clustering techniques can provide valuable insights for businesses to tailor their strategies and offerings to different customer groups. This analysis demonstrates how K-Means clustering and PCA can be applied to achieve this goal.
